# Extra Furnaces - A Minecraft 1.12.2 Mod
| NOW DEPRECATED/ABANDONED.

An idea occured to me that there was never any mod that I had come across with more Furnace features.
This mod aimed to change that. With more Furnaces with different smelting speeds and upgrades, so forth.

A minor dispute occurred between me and the designer. In which we both lost the motivation to work on this any further.
I might get back into modding soon. Although I am very unsure.

You are fully welcome to clone the code/use the textures to make your own mod using this.

## I need support/help! Please?

I do not offer support, I think this should be pretty obvious as to why.
HOWEVER, if you are having issues and you believe my code is responsible:
